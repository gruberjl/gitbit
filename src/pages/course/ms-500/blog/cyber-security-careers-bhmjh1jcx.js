                  <p>Lastly, a career in cybersecurity provides opportunities for personal and professional growth. As technology and cyber threats are constantly evolving, cybersecurity professionals must stay informed of the latest trends and developments in the field.

With the increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals, now is the perfect time to start a career in this dynamic and fast-paced field.</p>
                  <p>Before I jump into the jobs let me give a little background on how I found the information. The descriptions were generated by ChatGPT. The average pay was found through a basic Google search and the number of jobs available was totaling up the total jobs when searching on Dice.com and careerbuilder.com. So some of the results may not be exact.</p>
