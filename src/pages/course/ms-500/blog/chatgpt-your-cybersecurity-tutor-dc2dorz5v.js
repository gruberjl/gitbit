                  <blockquote>Get familiar with the Kusto Query Language (KQL): KQL is the language used to write advanced hunting queries in Microsoft 365 Defender. You should spend time learning the syntax and structure of KQL, as well as how to use it to query data in Microsoft 365 Defender.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>Review the Microsoft 365 Defender query library: Microsoft provides a library of pre-built queries that you can use as a starting point for your own queries. Spend time reviewing this library to get an idea of the types of queries you can run in Microsoft 365 Defender.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>Create your own queries: Once you have a good understanding of KQL and the query library, it's time to start creating your own queries. Start with simple queries and gradually increase their complexity as you gain more experience.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>Refine your queries: As you run queries, you may find that they return too much data or not enough data. Refining your queries is an important part of advanced hunting. Learn how to add filters to your queries to reduce the amount of data returned, or add more fields to get more context.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>Learn how to visualize query results: Once you have data from your queries, you'll want to visualize it to make it easier to understand. Microsoft 365 Defender provides several built-in visualization tools, so spend time learning how to use them.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>Stay up to date: Microsoft 365 Defender is constantly evolving, so it's important to stay up to date with the latest features and updates. Join the Microsoft Defender ATP community, attend webinars, and read the latest documentation to keep your skills sharp.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>By following this roadmap, you can develop a strong foundation for advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender and become proficient in detecting and investigating threats in your organization's environment.</blockquote>
                  <p>That's a great outline but there's a problem. There's no detail. There isn't any information on how to use KQL or advanced hunting. So let's get a little more granular. Let's ask ChatGPT to break down our learning for each day. I asked: "I'm looking to learn advanced hunting over 1 month. Please give me an outline of what I will need to learn every day" ChatGPT came back with:</p>

                  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/g9Y29Dm/daily-guide.png" alt="Advanced hunting guide by ChatGPT" height="889" width="722" style="aspect-ratio: auto 722 / 889; height: auto;" />
                  <p>20-day guide! Now we are getting somewhere. But there's still a problem. We don't have any information on how to learn this information. We need information. We need meat and potatoes. So let's ask for more information. I originally asked for links and resources but the links it provided were all broken :(</p>
                  <p>So then I asked for guides on each topic. For example, I skipped Days 1 and 2 because I already know the Defender admin center. I asked "Please provide me with an introduction to Kusto Query Language (KQL)" Here's what I got back:</p>
                  <blockquote>Kusto Query Language (KQL) is a powerful query language used in Microsoft Azure Data Explorer and other Microsoft services, including Microsoft 365 Defender, for searching and analyzing large datasets. It was developed by Microsoft for querying and analyzing data stored in different data sources, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>KQL is similar to SQL in terms of syntax and structure, but with some key differences. KQL uses a series of operators, keywords, and functions to query data. For example, you can use the "where" operator to filter data, the "project" operator to select specific columns, and the "summarize" operator to aggregate data.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>KQL also includes a number of powerful functions for processing and manipulating data. For example, you can use the "parse" function to extract data from a string, the "datetime" function to work with dates and times, and the "bin" function to group data into intervals.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>One of the most powerful features of KQL is its ability to handle large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. It does this through a combination of query optimization techniques, caching, and distributed computing.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>Overall, KQL is a versatile and flexible language that can be used to analyze and extract insights from a wide range of data sources. It is well-suited for working with large datasets and can be used by data analysts, security professionals, and others who need to extract insights from complex data sources.</blockquote>
                  <p>Here's another search: "How do I use KQL in the Microsoft 365 Defender admin center?" This returned some great info too.</p>
                  <blockquote>In the Microsoft 365 Defender admin center, you can use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to search and analyze data from your organization's devices, users, and applications. Here are the basic steps to use KQL in the Defender admin center:</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>Log in to the Microsoft 365 Defender admin center with your credentials.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>Navigate to the "Advanced hunting" section by clicking on "Advanced hunting" in the left-hand navigation menu.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>On the Advanced hunting page, you will see a search box where you can enter your KQL query. You can also select a pre-defined query from the "Query library" on the right-hand side of the page, or you can create a new query by clicking on the "New query" button.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>Once you have entered your query, click on the "Run" button to execute the query.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>The results of your query will be displayed in a table on the right-hand side of the page. You can filter and sort the results by clicking on the column headers or by using the filter and sort controls at the top of the table.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>You can also export the results of your query by clicking on the "Export" button and selecting the format (CSV or JSON) and columns you want to export.</blockquote>
                  <blockquote>It's important to note that KQL syntax can be complex, so it's helpful to refer to documentation and tutorials to learn more about the language and how to use it effectively. Microsoft provides extensive documentation and training resources for KQL, including video tutorials, documentation, and sample queries.</blockquote>
                  <p>Lastly, ChatGPT won't be replacing many jobs any time soon. ChatGPT isn't perfect. For example, I tried to get the syntax to get the sign-in log failures from Advanced Query. It should look like this: "AADSpnSignInEventsBeta | where ErrorCode &gt; 0" but ChatGPT kept returning "SigninLogs | where ResultType == "0" and TimeGenerated &gt; ago(24h)" which is the syntax for Microsoft Sentinel.</p>
