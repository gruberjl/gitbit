# Welcome to Gitbit

GitBit was created to help the world get better at securing their Microsoft 365 tenants. A lot of organizations are now using Microsoft 365 but how many of them are secure? Not many!

Go to https://www.gitbit.org to get started. Or you can jump right into one of our lessons. Or jump right into the practice questions. The practice questions are very similar to the questions you'll find on the MS-500 certification by Microsoft.
